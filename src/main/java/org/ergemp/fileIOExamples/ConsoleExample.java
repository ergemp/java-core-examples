        System.in is an InputStream which is connected to keyboard input of console programs.
        So, if you want to give any input from your keyboard, youâ€™d have to use System.in to read that input.
        We can read the input using same read() methods provided by InputStream.

        System.out is a PrintStream which is used to print something on console.
        We can use all methods provided by PrintStream with System.out,
        System.out.println being the most popularly used one.
